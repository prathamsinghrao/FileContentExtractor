# FileContentExtractor

**FileContentExtractor** is a .NET Core Web API designed to extract content from various file formats including PDF, DOCX, PPTX, HTML, JPG, PNG, JPEG, and TXT. The API provides easy integration, structured data output, and is built with scalability in mind.

In future updates, the project will include a **React dashboard** for file uploads, real-time extraction, and enhanced data management.

## Features
- Extract content from the following file formats:
  - **PDF**
  - **DOCX**
  - **PPTX**
  - **HTML**
  - **JPG**
  - **PNG**
  - **JPEG**
  - **TXT**
- Easy integration with other systems.
- Structured data output (JSON).
- Designed for scalability and performance.
- Future **React dashboard** for file uploads and real-time extraction.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **.NET Core SDK** (3.1 or higher)
- **Visual Studio** or **Visual Studio Code**
- **Postman** or any API testing tool (optional for testing the API)

### Steps to Run the API Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FileContentExtractor.git
   cd FileContentExtractor
   ```

2. **Restore the dependencies**:
   In the project root directory, run:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Run the project**:
   Run the following command to start the API:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   The API will now be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

   - **Description**: Upload a file and extract its content.
   - **Request Body**: Multipart file
   - **Response**: Structured data in JSON format with extracted content.

   **Request Example** (using **curl**):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/extract-content" -F "file=@path_to_your_file.pdf"
   ```

   **Response Example**:
   ```json
   {
     "fileName": "example.pdf",
     "extractedText": "This is the extracted text from the PDF file.",
     "status": "success"
   }
   ```

### 2. **GET /api/status**
   - **Description**: Check the status of the API service.
   - **Response Example**:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "API is running"
   }
   ```

## Usage

Once the API is running, you can begin sending requests to extract content from files. Here's how you can interact with the API:

1. **POST Request to `/api/extract-content`**: This endpoint allows you to upload a file and get the extracted content.
   
   **Example**:
   - **POST** `http://localhost:5000/api/extract-content`
   - Attach a file (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, HTML, JPG, PNG, JPEG, TXT).

   **Response Example**:
   ```json
   {
     "fileName": "sample.pdf",
     "extractedText": "Extracted content from the PDF file.",
     "status": "success"
   }
   ```

2. **GET Request to `/api/status`**: Use this endpoint to check if the API is running.
   
   **Example**:
   - **GET** `http://localhost:5000/api/status`

   **Response Example**:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "API is running"
   }
   ```

## Future Updates
- **React Dashboard**: A React-based frontend for file uploads and real-time extraction.
- **Real-time Content Extraction**: Support for extracting content from files in real-time with progress updates.
- **Advanced Data Management**: Features to manage extracted data, search, filter, and integrate with databases.
- **Support for Additional File Formats**: Expansion of supported file types based on user feedback and requirements.
